# Options for Using beta@peachsounds.com

## Option 1: Own the Domain (Best Solution)

If you own `peachsounds.com`:

1. **Purchase/Use the domain** (if you don't already own it)
   - Register at Namecheap, GoDaddy, Google Domains, etc.
   - Cost: ~$10-15/year

2. **Set up SendGrid:**
   - Sign up for SendGrid (free tier: 100 emails/day)
   - Go to Settings → Sender Authentication → Domain Authentication
   - Add `peachsounds.com`
   - Add the DNS records SendGrid provides to your domain
   - Wait for verification (usually a few hours)

3. **Connect to EmailJS:**
   - Use SendGrid service in EmailJS (not Gmail)
   - Set "From Email" in template to `beta@peachsounds.com`
   - Done!

**Result:** Emails will come from `beta@peachsounds.com` ✅

## Option 2: Use a Subdomain (If You Own the Domain)

If you own `peachsounds.com`, you can also use:
- `beta@mail.peachsounds.com`
- `noreply@peachsounds.com`
- Any subdomain you want

Same setup process as Option 1.

## Option 3: Use a Different Email Address (If You Don't Own the Domain)

If you don't own `peachsounds.com`, you have these options:

### 3a. Use Your Own Domain
- Register your own domain (e.g., `yourname.com`)
- Set up SendGrid with that domain
- Use `beta@yourname.com` or `beta@mail.yourname.com`

### 3b. Use a Free Email Service Domain
- Use a service like Mailgun's free tier
- They provide a subdomain like `beta@mg.yourname.com`
- Not as professional but works

### 3c. Use Gmail with Display Name Only
- Keep using Gmail
- Set display name to "DynamicMusicVST Beta"
- Email will show as: `DynamicMusicVST Beta <yourgmail@gmail.com>`
- Not ideal but works without domain ownership

## Option 4: Purchase the Domain

If `peachsounds.com` is available:

1. **Check availability:**
   - Go to Namecheap, GoDaddy, or Google Domains
   - Search for `peachsounds.com`
   - If available, purchase it (~$10-15/year)

2. **Set up email:**
   - Follow Option 1 steps above
   - You'll have full control over the domain

## Recommendation

**If you're building a product called "PeachSounds":**
- You should own the domain anyway for branding
- It's worth the $10-15/year
- Makes you look more professional
- Allows you to set up a website, email, etc.

**Quick Setup After Purchasing:**
1. Buy domain (5 minutes)
2. Set up SendGrid (10 minutes)
3. Add DNS records (5 minutes)
4. Wait for verification (few hours)
5. Connect to EmailJS (2 minutes)
6. Done!

## Current Status

Right now you're seeing:
```
beta@peachsounds.com <sareldu@gmail.com>
```

This means:
- Display name: `beta@peachsounds.com` ✅
- Actual sender: `sareldu@gmail.com` ❌

To fix this, you need to own the domain and use SendGrid (or similar service that supports custom domains).
